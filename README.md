# Nanonium 🐬
### A Project by Krishnendu Mitra ⚛️

## Introduction
Welcome to **Nanonium**, an innovative **SQL Bot** that converts user queries into SQL statements. Whether you're a non-technical user or a student learning SQL, Nanonium makes generating SQL queries as simple as chatting! You just need to ask a question, and Nanonium will provide you with the corresponding SQL query.

## Aim 🎯
Our goal is to empower users by enabling them to easily convert natural language questions into SQL queries. With **Nanonium**, you can:
1. **Generate** SQL queries from everyday questions.
2. **Save time** by instantly getting the correct SQL queries without needing to know SQL syntax.
3. **Learn SQL**: Use it as a tool to understand how queries are constructed in SQL.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Chat Interface**: Users type in questions like "Show me all students whose marks are greater than 80 in mathematics."
2. **Processing**: The question is processed by the bot, which understands the query's context and structure using Machine Learning.
3. **SQL Generation**: The bot converts the user's question into a valid SQL query. For example, "Show me all students whose marks are greater than 80 in mathematics" will generate:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks > 80 AND subject = 'mathematics';
   ```
4. **Output**: The generated SQL query is displayed back to the user.

## Technologies Used 🖥️
- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for rendering dynamic content in the browser.
- **Backend**: Node.js to handle server-side requests and process user queries.
- **Machine Learning**: Transformer models for understanding and training the query generation.
- **Data**: Simple JSON format to store the datasets for training the bot and generating queries.

## Programming Languages 💻
- **JavaScript** (Node.js, EJS)
- **Python** (Machine Learning Models, Transformer)
- **JSON** (Data Storage)
- **HTML/CSS** (UI/UX Design)

## Advance Stack Technology 🖼️

The JPEN stack is a technology stack that combines the power of JSON, Python, Embedded JavaScript, and Node.js. JSON (J) is used for level data interchange and storage, providing a lightweight and flexible format for data exchange. Python (P) is used for mechine learning scripting, offering a robust and versatile language for building machine learning empower web applications. Embedded JavaScript (E) allows for dynamic client-side scripting, enabling interactive user experiences. Finally, Node.js (N) provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling fast and scalable web development. Together, the JPEN stack enables developers to build scalable, and data driven or deep learning combined web applications.

## Why We Created This Project ❓
Many users, especially those from non-technical backgrounds, often need SQL queries for daily tasks but struggle with learning or writing them. Similarly, students in courses related to databases often need a quick and easy way to generate queries for their assignments. **Nanonium** was created to solve these problems and make SQL queries accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise. It's also a great tool for students to learn SQL through interactive query generation.
